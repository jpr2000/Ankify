**My Todos**

- Can update the system prompt and input directly to experiment with different outputs
- Continue to query OpenAI when responses are shortened
- sample prompts that I frequently use so I dont have to manually type them
- Modal doesn't close when clicking off and clicking close actually closes the modal.

- Ability to export via csv for other users
   - Would be at least good to have some backup plan if Anki calls are failing

- Long-term offline use
   - Locally hosted model (like GTranslate) to do translation for you
   - Could also pull from dictionary

===
- Remove saved words

**General Improvements**
- [ ] Add a clear project description and usage instructions to the README.md
- [ ] Add screenshots or a demo GIF to the README.md
- [ ] Add comments and documentation to backend and frontend code
- [ ] Refactor code for readability and maintainability (e.g., modularize JS, extract inline styles/scripts)
- [ ] Add error handling and user feedback for all API/network failures
- [ ] Add input validation and sanitization on both frontend and backend

**Frontend (index.html)**
- [ ] Move inline JS and CSS to separate files (e.g., `main.js`, `styles.css`)
- [ ] Add a favicon and improve meta tags for SEO/social sharing
- [ ] Make the UI fully responsive and mobile-friendly (test on various devices)

- [ ] Add user authentication if needed (for saving cards, etc.)
- [ ] Add a settings page (e.g., to change language pairs, API keys, etc.)
- [ ] Add a way to export/import saved sentences/cards
- [ ] Add tests for frontend logic (unit and integration)

**Backend (deepl-proxy.js)**
- [ ] Move sensitive keys (DEEPL, OpenAI) to `.env` and document this in README
- [ ] Add rate limiting and security headers (e.g., helmet) for production
- [ ] Add logging (with a library, not just console.log)
- [ ] Add input validation (e.g., using Joi or express-validator)
- [ ] Add tests for API endpoints (unit and integration)
- [ ] Add OpenAPI/Swagger documentation for the API
- [ ] Add support for deployment environments (dev, prod)
- [ ] Add Dockerfile and docker-compose for easy deployment
- [ ] Add health check endpoint

**Production Readiness**
- [ ] Set up environment variables for all secrets and endpoints
- [ ] Add HTTPS support (document how to set up SSL)
- [ ] Add CI/CD pipeline (GitHub Actions, etc.) for linting, testing, and deployment
- [ ] Deploy to a cloud provider (Vercel, Netlify, Heroku, AWS, etc.)
- [ ] Monitor uptime and errors (e.g., with Sentry, LogRocket, or similar)
- [ ] Set up proper CORS configuration for production
- [ ] Add analytics (optional, privacy-respecting)

**Quality & Community**
- [ ] Add a code of conduct and contributing guidelines
- [ ] Add issue and PR templates
- [ ] Add license file

Production TODOS:

Absolutely! Here’s a focused production deployment checklist for your app, tailored for low-usage (just you), based on your todo file and best practices:

---

## Production Deployment Checklist

### 1. Environment & Secrets
- [ ] Move all sensitive keys (DEEPL, OpenAI, etc.) to a `.env` file (never commit this file).
- [ ] Update code to read secrets from environment variables.
- [ ] Document required environment variables in the README.

### 2. Security & Stability
- [ ] Add basic rate limiting to backend endpoints.
- [ ] Add security headers (e.g., using helmet for Express).
- [ ] Set up proper CORS configuration (restrict origins as needed).
- [ ] Add input validation and sanitization on backend (e.g., Joi or express-validator).
- [ ] Add error handling for all API/network failures.

### 3. Deployment
- [ ] Add a `Dockerfile` and (optionally) `docker-compose.yml` for easy deployment.
- [ ] Add a health check endpoint to backend.
- [ ] Set up HTTPS (self-signed or via a provider like Let’s Encrypt).
- [ ] Choose a hosting provider (Vercel, Netlify, Heroku, AWS, etc.) and deploy.
- [ ] Set up environment variables/secrets in the hosting provider’s dashboard.

### 4. Monitoring & Maintenance
- [ ] Add basic logging (use a library, not just console.log).
- [ ] (Optional) Set up uptime/error monitoring (Sentry, LogRocket, or similar).

### 5. Documentation & Usability
- [ ] Add a clear project description and usage instructions to the README.
- [ ] Document deployment steps and environment variables in the README.
- [ ] (Optional) Add OpenAPI/Swagger docs for your API.

### 6. Frontend
- [ ] Make sure the UI is usable on your devices (basic responsiveness).
- [ ] Add loading indicators and error messages for async actions.
- [ ] Add a favicon and improve meta tags for SEO/social sharing.

**Minimum for a solo, low-usage deployment:**  
If you want to keep it super simple, you can skip Docker and advanced monitoring, but you should still:
- Use environment variables for secrets,
- Add basic security (rate limiting, CORS, helmet),
- Deploy to a host with HTTPS,
- Document your setup for future reference.
